- Parsing in DataController needs a bit more error checking when converting from xml values to model values. [ollie?]
- SceneView does not perform a glRotate. [ollie]
- SceneView update needs to be smarter with regards to whether there are 2 attackers or not.
- DataModel deconstructor
	- DataModel owns all the pointers to scene/sequence stuff.
- Where to call sequence.loadMovie?
	- in datacontroller when creating sequence?
	- call movie.play() in setCurrentSequence()
	- sequence movie and loop movie xml data
- xml movie datapath
	- relative to OF data path or absolute paths?
	- Can set a switch for that?
		- adds cruft properties to the model, better to just pick one or the other
		- I think OF data path.
	- Should guess movie paths in DataController from scene and sequence name.
